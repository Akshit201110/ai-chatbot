# AI Chatbot
This project is a Python-based AI chatbot developed to demonstrate efficient API integration and robust data handling techniques.

Key Features:

API Handling:
The chatbot interacts with external APIs to retrieve dynamic data, authenticate users, and perform real-time operations. It includes mechanisms for secure communication, error handling, response validation, and asynchronous processing to ensure reliability and performance.

Data Management:
The chatbot uses Pythonâ€™s data processing libraries to manage user interactions, session histories, and conversation flows. It organizes both structured and unstructured data effectively to maintain context-aware dialogues and enhance user experience.

Scalability and Integration:
The chatbot is designed to be modular and scalable, making it easy to integrate into web applications, messaging platforms, and customer service workflows.
